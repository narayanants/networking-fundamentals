Communication Protocols
IP and Mac Addresses
Peer to Peer = Decentralized
Client Server = Centralized
Computer Networking Protocols
Protocols are rules how computers exchange data and enable effective communication
OSI Models - Upper Layers + Lower Layers
Media Access Card (MAC) Addresses - Physical address of the network adapter card
IP address - Uniquely identify a device on an IP Network
Mac Addresses - Layer 2 of OSI
IP addresses - Layer 3 of OSI
Half Duplex - send and receive data but not at the same time
Full Duplex - opposite of half duplex
Unicast - one to one
Multicast - One to many
Broadcast - One to All
Physical Topologies - Placement and connection of network devices
Logical Topologies - How data flows through the network
Wired Topologies - Bus, Ring, Star, Mesh
Wireless Topologies - Wifi
Network Interface Card - NIC
Hubs - No longer used, legacy
Switches - Address of devices inside MAC Address Table, Operates at Layer 2 of OSI
Router - Connect different networks together, use IP addresses, Layer 3 of OSI
Modem - modulate one signal to another
SOHO - Small office home office, All in one wireless Router
Firewalls - Protects your network from Malicious Network Activity, Network(hardware) and Host(Software) based Firewall
DHCP Servers - Dynamic Host Config Protocol, Auto assign IP address on IP network
Protocols - Rule how we exchange data back and forth
Port - Unique port number to a protocol
Sockets - Combination of Port numbers and IP addresses
